### Simpsons Rule
  * This is a function that numerically integrates experimental data using Simpson's 1/3 Rule
  * Although, an addition to this algorithm is that if there are an odd number of intervals in the data, the trapezoidal rule is used for the last interval.
  * The algorith function is used in the form: Simpson_Richard(x,y) where 
  
  **Inputs:**
  
     x - independant experimental data 
     y - dependant experimental data
  
  **Outputs:**
  
     I - the approximate integral
